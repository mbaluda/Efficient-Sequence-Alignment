Efficient implementation of algorithms for optimal resolution of the Peerwise Sequence Alignment problem.
Sequence Alignment has  a  great  biological  interest  being  a  key  to  finding  important  regions in the genome, determining its functions and uncovering evolutionary
forces.
This work is part of the ALiBio project which aim is to provide a collection of useful libraries for the development of bioinformatics programs, with special regard to the efficiency of the implementation
The code is an example of literate programming.
